This repository demonstrates an uncommon HTML bug related to manipulating the DOM before elements are fully rendered. The bug occurs when attempting to remove or modify an element using JavaScript before it has been added to the page's Document Object Model (DOM). This often leads to unexpected JavaScript errors.  The solution provided addresses this by ensuring that the DOM manipulation occurs only after the element is fully rendered.
